winter.py is a totally standalone module, so place it wherever you want.  You
can pick it up and drop it wherever you want, and it'll import just fine.  If
you're in the mood, you can also install it as you would any other Python
package by the magic of good old distutils.  Just do

    python winter.py install
    
Which is slightly unconventional, I know, but I really want to keep it down to
a single source file.
